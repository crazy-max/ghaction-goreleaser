## üíÖ Customizing

### inputs

Following inputs can be used as `step.with` keys

| Name          | Type    | Default   | Description                              |
|---------------|---------|-----------|------------------------------------------|
| `version`     | String  | `latest`  | GoReleaser version. Example: `v0.117.0`  |
| `args`        | String  |           | Arguments to pass to GoReleaser          |
| `key`         | String  |           | Private key to import

### Signing

If signing is enabled in your GoReleaser configuration, populate the `key` input with your private key
and reference the key in your signing configuration, e.g.

```
signs:
  - artifacts: checksum
    args: ["--batch", "-u", "<key id, fingerprint, email, ...>", "--output", "${signature}", "--detach-sign", "${artifact}"]
```

This feature is currently only compatible when using the default `gpg` command and a private key without a passphrase.
